    <h3 style="color: #333;">Formation of Present Simple</h3>

    <h4 style="color: #444;">Affirmative sentences:</h4>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        For affirmative sentences, the base form of the verb is used. For example:
        <br> - I work. (I am describing my habitual action.)
        <br> - She plays. (A regular action, referring to her.)
    </p>

    <h4 style="color: #444;">Negative sentences:</h4>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        In negative sentences, the auxiliary verb "do/does" is used with the particle "not". For example:
        <br> - I do not work. (Expresses a negative action.)
        <br> - He does not play. (Shows that he is not involved in the action.)
    </p>

    <h4 style="color: #444;">Questions:</h4>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        Questions in the Present Simple tense are formed using the auxiliary verb "do/does" before the subject:
        <br> - Do you work? (Asking about a habitual action.)
        <br> - Does she play? (Inquiring about her regular activity.)
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #333;">Usage rules:</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        - "Do" is used with I, you, we, they.
        <br> - "Does" is used with he, she, it.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        These rules ensure correct usage of the Present Simple tense in various contexts.
