  <h1>Rule: Present Simple Passive and Past Simple Passive</h1>

  <p><strong>What is Present Simple Passive and Past Simple Passive?</strong></p>
  <p>1. <strong>Present Simple Passive</strong> (present tense in passive voice) is used to express an action that happens regularly or is a general fact, while the focus is not on who is performing the action. In this tense, the subject (the person performing the action) may not be important or specified.</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Past Simple Passive</strong> (past tense in passive voice) is used to describe actions that happened in the past, with the focus on the object that underwent the action, rather than the one who performed it.</p>

  <p><strong>What is the difference between passive and active voice?</strong></p>
  <p>In the active voice, the <strong>subject</strong> performs an action on the object, while in the passive voice, the object undergoes the action. In the passive voice, it may not be necessary to mention who is performing the action (if it is not important or unknown).</p>
  <p>Active voice: <em>I read the book.</em> (I am reading the book.)</p>
  <p>Passive voice: <em>The book is read by me.</em> (The book is being read by me.)</p>
