        - Are you studying English? (This structure is for questions where the auxiliary verb precedes the subject.)<br>
        - Is he playing football? (Similar structure with "is" for singular subjects.)<br>
        - Am I making noise? (Used with "I" and "am.")
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        - "Am" is used only with "I": Am I late? <br>
        - "Is" is used with singular subjects: Is she coming? <br>
        - "Are" is used with plural subjects and with "you": Are they here?
    </p>
