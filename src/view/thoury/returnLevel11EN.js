    <h2 style="color: #333;">Questions with the verb "to be" (Present/Past Simple)</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        To form interrogative sentences with the verb to be in the present (Present Simple) or past tense (Past Simple), the verb is placed first before the subject.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #333;">Example 1:</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        Statement: You are ready.<br>
        Question: Are you ready?
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: #333;">Example 2:</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        Statement: He was tired.<br>
        Question: Was he tired?
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #333;">Features:</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
        Yes/no questions always require inversion: the verb to be (in any form) comes before the subject. 
        This rule does not apply to sentences with other verbs (not to be), where auxiliary verbs (do, does, did) are used.
