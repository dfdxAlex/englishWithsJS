    <h2 style="color: #555;">Definition:</h2>
    <p>
        Present Simple is used to describe habitual actions, facts, and routines. It often includes adverbs of frequency to indicate how often an action takes place.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #555;">Key Points:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adverbs of Frequency:</strong> Commonly used adverbs of frequency include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Always</li>
            <li>Usually</li>
            <li>Often</li>
            <li>Sometimes</li>
            <li>Rarely</li>
            <li>Never</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: #555;">Formation:</h2>
    <h3>1. Affirmative Sentences:</h3>
    <p>
        Use the base form of the verb. For example:
        <br>I always eat breakfast.
        <br>She usually goes for a walk.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Negative Sentences:</h3>
    <p>
        Use the auxiliary verb do/does + not + base verb. For example:
        <br>I do not eat breakfast.
        <br>He does not go for a walk.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Questions:</h3>
    <p>
        Form questions by placing do/does before the subject:
        <br>Do you always eat breakfast?
        <br>Does she usually go for a walk?
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #555;">Usage:</h2>
    <p>
        When using adverbs of frequency, they typically appear before the main verb but after the verb "to be." For example:
        <br>I always play football.
        <br>He is often late.
    </p>

    <p>
        This structure helps clearly convey the frequency of actions in the present simple tense.
