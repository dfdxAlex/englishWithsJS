    Present Perfect: Rules for Using <code>For</code>, <code>Since</code>, and <code>Ago</code>
  </h2>
    <h3>
        <strong>For</strong>
    </h3>
    <p><strong>For</strong> is used to indicate the duration of an action or state (over a period of time).</p>
    <p>Use <strong>for</strong> when you want to express how long something has been happening.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have lived here <strong>for</strong> five years. – The action of living started in the past and continues to the present.</li>
        <li>She has worked at the company <strong>for</strong> two months. – Duration emphasizes continuity.</li>
        <li>They have known each other <strong>for</strong> a long time. – Shows ongoing relationship.</li>
        <li>We have been waiting <strong>for</strong> 30 minutes. – Duration of a current or recent activity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>For</strong> is used with general time periods like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>days</li>
        <li>weeks</li>
        <li>months</li>
        <li>years</li>
        <li>hours</li>
        <li>minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <strong>Since</strong>
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Since</strong> is used to indicate the specific starting point of an action.</p>
    <p>Use <strong>since</strong> when you want to highlight the exact time when something began.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have lived here <strong>since</strong> 2010. – Action started at a specific point and continues to now.</li>
        <li>She has worked at the company <strong>since</strong> last month. – Specifies starting point of employment.</li>
        <li>They have known each other <strong>since</strong> childhood. – Beginning of relationship is emphasized.</li>
        <li>We have been friends <strong>since</strong> high school. – Shows origin of ongoing friendship.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Since</strong> is used with specific moments in time like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>years</li>
        <li>months</li>
        <li>dates</li>
        <li>days of the week</li>
        <li>events</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <strong>Ago</strong>
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ago</strong> is used to indicate how much time has passed since an action. It is only used with <strong>Past Simple</strong>, not Present Perfect.</p>
    <p>Use <strong>ago</strong> to show an action occurred in the past relative to now.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I met him <strong>two days ago</strong>. – Refers to a specific past event.</li>
        <li>We went to the cinema <strong>a week ago</strong>. – Emphasizes completed past action.</li>
        <li>She left the office <strong>three hours ago</strong>. – Points to a finished action in the past.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Ago</strong> is never used with Present Perfect and always requires Past Simple to indicate past time.</p>
