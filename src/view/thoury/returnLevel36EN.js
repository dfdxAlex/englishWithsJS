            Third group verbs (irregular verbs) do not follow the standard rules for forming the past tense and past participle. These verbs have unique forms that need to be memorized, as they cannot be predicted based on rules.

          <!-- Main features -->
          <h5>Main Features:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Unchanged base form:</strong> For example, the verb <em>read</em> keeps the same spelling in all forms, but the pronunciation differs:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Present:</strong> [riːd]</li>
                <li><strong>Past:</strong> [rɛd]</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Form Differences:</strong> The forms of irregular verbs can be unique for each of their tenses. Example:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Base Form:</strong> <em>begin</em> — <strong>Past Simple:</strong> <em>began</em> — <strong>Past Participle:</strong> <em>begun</em></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Where are they used -->
          <h5>Where are they used:</h5>
          <p>Irregular verbs are widely used in English and appear in both spoken and written language. They are essential for correct formation of various tense constructions and are used in the following contexts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Actions in the past:</strong> For example, in the sentence <em>"She went to the store."</em>, where the verb <em>went</em> is the irregular form of <em>go</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Present Perfect tense:</strong> In the sentence <em>"He has written a letter."</em>, the form <em>written</em> of the verb <em>write</em> is used to create Present Perfect.</li>
            <li><strong>Passive voice:</strong> In the sentence <em>"The book was written by an unknown author."</em>, the form <em>written</em> of <em>write</em> is used.</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Role of learning -->
          <h5>Role of Learning:</h5>
          <p>Learning irregular verbs is crucial for correctly forming sentences in English, especially in the past tense and in perfect constructions. These verbs are an important part of everyday speech and writing. In textbooks like <em>Essential Grammar in Use</em> by Raymond Murphy, irregular verbs are given special attention, including tables for memorization.</p>
