  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
      <p><strong>Why is Past Simple used?</strong></p>
      <p>Past Simple is used to describe actions, events, or states that happened in the past. This tense indicates that the action is complete and has no connection with the present.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For telling about past events: <strong>I visited Paris last year.</strong></li>
        <li>For describing habits in the past: <strong>She always walked to school as a child.</strong></li>
        <li>For mentioning one-time actions in the past: <strong>He broke his arm yesterday.</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How to form negative sentences?</strong></p>
      <p>To make a sentence negative in Past Simple, use the auxiliary verb <code>did</code> + <code>not</code> (<code>didn't</code>) before the base form of the main verb. The main verb is used in its base form (without the <code>-ed</code> ending).</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Subject + did not (didn't) + verb (base form).</code></pre>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>I didn't eat</strong> breakfast this morning.</li>
        <li><strong>She didn't go</strong> to the party last night.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How to form questions?</strong></p>
      <p>To make a question in Past Simple, use the auxiliary verb <code>did</code>. It is placed before the subject, and the main verb stays in its base form.</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
      <pre><code>Did + subject + verb (base form)?</code></pre>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Did</strong> you <strong>watch</strong> the movie yesterday?</li>
        <li><strong>Did</strong> they <strong>finish</strong> their homework on time?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>When are negative sentences and questions used?</strong></p>
      <p>Negative sentences are used to say that something did not happen: <strong>He didn't call me.</strong></p>
      <p>Questions are used to ask whether an action or event happened: <strong>Did she call you?</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Special Notes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In negatives and questions, the main verb always remains in its base form (we don't add <code>-ed</code> or any other past tense form).</li>
        <li>Time indicators such as <strong>yesterday</strong>, <strong>last week</strong>, <strong>two years ago</strong> help to indicate that the event occurred in the past.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Statement:</strong> She arrived late.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative:</strong> She didnâ€™t arrive late.</li>
        <li><strong>Question:</strong> Did she arrive late?</li>
